# Alternative Features Page (Version 2)

This directory contains an alternative implementation of the features page with a different design approach.

## Status
- **Active**: No (not currently linked from main navigation)
- **Purpose**: Alternative design/experimental
- **Primary Version**: `/features/` is the main features page

## Key Differences from /features/

### Design
- Uses a more minimal, outcome-focused approach
- Different navigation structure
- Simplified hero section

### Content
- Emphasizes "outcome-led features"
- Focuses on governed agency, native integrations, rolling context
- More investor-focused language

### Technical
- Different CSS architecture (styles.css)
- Multiple script files (app.js, script.js, scripts.js)
- Different component structure

## Preservation Rationale

This directory is preserved as part of the consolidation effort to ensure no features are lost. While not currently in use, it may contain valuable alternative implementations or design patterns that could be useful for:

1. A/B testing different feature presentations
2. Future redesigns
3. Specific audience targeting (investor vs. user-focused)
4. Alternative mobile-first implementations

## Usage

This version is not currently linked from the main navigation. To use it:
- Direct URL: `/features2/`
- May be activated for testing or specific campaigns

## Migration Notes

If you want to use elements from this page in the main features page:
1. Review the unique content and design patterns
2. Extract reusable components to shared location
3. Update `/features/` with desired improvements
4. Test thoroughly before deployment
