# Trust.md

## Purpose
This document defines the principles, practices, and commitments required to establish and maintain **trust** across a company, its products, and its processes. Trust is not a marketing claim — it is a measurable outcome of transparency, reliability, and accountability.

---

## 1. Product-Level Trust

### 1.1 Transparency
- Every product decision, recommendation, or output must be explainable.
- Provide clear audit trails and logs for all critical actions.
- Document assumptions, data sources, and decision paths.

### 1.2 Reliability
- Commit to enterprise-grade uptime and performance SLAs.
- Ensure reproducibility of results across environments.
- Maintain rigorous testing, monitoring, and error-handling frameworks.

### 1.3 Compliance & Security
- Align with relevant standards (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA).
- Embed compliance checks into product workflows.
- Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

### 1.4 User Control
- Provide configurable governance hooks (e.g., data residency, access controls).
- Allow customers to export, review, and delete their data.
- Offer clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms for sensitive features.

---

## 2. Process-Level Trust

### 2.1 Validation
- Publish case studies and reference implementations.
- Engage independent auditors or third parties to validate outputs.
- Provide reproducible benchmarks for performance and accuracy.

### 2.2 Risk Management
- Explicitly model risks (data, cost, talent, compliance).
- Provide mitigation strategies alongside recommendations.
- Maintain a risk register for all enterprise engagements.

### 2.3 Customer Engagement
- Establish structured pilot-to-production pathways.
- Share transparent roadmaps and release notes.
- Respond to customer feedback with documented action.

---

## 3. Ecosystem-Level Trust

### 3.1 Partnerships
- Collaborate with advisory firms, compliance bodies, and industry consortia.
- Build credibility through co-validation with trusted partners.

### 3.2 Vendor & Marketplace Integrity
- Vet and continuously audit vendors in any marketplace or ecosystem.
- Maintain transparent vendor tiers and performance metrics.
- Enforce accountability through contracts and ongoing monitoring.

### 3.3 Regulatory Alignment
- Proactively engage with regulators and standards bodies.
- Anticipate compliance requirements (e.g., AI Acts, data protection laws).
- Publish transparency reports on regulatory adherence.

---

## 4. Cultural Trust

### 4.1 Transparency
- Communicate pricing, terms, and limitations clearly.
- Avoid hidden costs or lock-in mechanisms.

### 4.2 Accountability
- Define clear ownership for product reliability and customer outcomes.
- Publish SLAs and track adherence publicly.

### 4.3 Security-First Mindset
- Adopt “secure by design” principles.
- Run bug bounty programs and disclose vulnerabilities responsibly.

### 4.4 Long-Term Commitment
- Demonstrate continuity of service and support.
- Build trust through consistency, not just innovation.

---

## 5. Governance of Trust

- This document is a **living contract**: it must be reviewed quarterly.
- Updates require cross-functional approval (Product, Security, Compliance, Leadership).
- Metrics of trust (uptime, auditability, compliance certifications, customer satisfaction) must be tracked and published.

## 6. Guiding Principle

> **Trust is earned through evidence, not claimed through words.**
