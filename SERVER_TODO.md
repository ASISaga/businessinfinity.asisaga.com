## Success Metrics

Track the following to measure implementation success:

- **API Availability**: > 99.9% uptime for compliance APIs
- **Response Time**: < 200ms P95 for GET endpoints, < 2s P95 for POST endpoints
- **Data Export Time**: < 24 hours from request to delivery
- **Deletion Completion**: < 48 hours from verification to completion
- **Audit Trail Latency**: < 1 minute from event to availability in API
- **Security Incidents**: Zero data breaches
- **Compliance**: 100% adherence to retention policies

---

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

1. **Data Export Format**: JSON, CSV, or both? Include raw data or formatted reports?
2. **Deletion Verification**: Email link sufficient, or require additional verification (e.g., SMS)?
3. **Audit Trail Granularity**: What level of detail? Every API call or just data modifications?
4. **Public API Access**: Which compliance endpoints should be public vs. authenticated?
5. **Data Residency**: Do we need multi-region support? Customer choice of region?
6. **Customer-Managed Keys**: Should we support customer-managed encryption keys (BYOK)?
7. **Compliance Automation**: Auto-renew certifications or manual process?
8. **Third-party Integrations**: How to track and audit third-party data processors?

---

## Dependencies

- Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) for authentication
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Azure Storage for data and backups
- Azure Monitor / Log Analytics for logging
- Email service for notifications (SendGrid, Azure Communication Services)
- Compliance management platform (TrustArc, OneTrust, or custom)
