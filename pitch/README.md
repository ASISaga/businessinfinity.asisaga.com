# Investor Pitch Page (Primary)

This directory contains the original investor pitch implementation.

## Status
- **Active**: No (not currently linked)
- **Purpose**: Investor presentation with interactive elements
- **Alternative**: `/pitch2/` has simpler one-pager approach

## Implementation

This version contains:
- Complex interactive presentation (`app.js` - 8.7KB)
- More sophisticated pitch logic
- Potentially animated or interactive elements

### Files
- `index.html` - Main HTML (943 bytes - minimal structure)
- `app.js` - Application logic (8.7KB - main functionality)
- `styles.css` - Styling (2.4KB)

## Technical Notes

The large `app.js` file suggests this version may include:
- Interactive pitch deck functionality
- Dynamic data visualization
- Animated transitions
- Form handling or data collection
- More complex investor-specific features

## vs /pitch2/

`/pitch2/` provides:
- Simpler static one-pager approach
- Focus on core messaging (problem, insight, solution, curve, ask)
- Lighter weight implementation
- Easier to update and maintain

## Recommendation

**Evaluation Needed**: Need to review `app.js` to understand:
1. What interactive features are implemented
2. Whether they add value for investor presentations
3. If they could be simplified or extracted
4. Performance implications

**Consider**:
- If interactive features are valuable, enhance this version
- If simpler is better, use `/pitch2/` as primary
- Could combine best of both (simple page + optional interactivity)

## Use Cases

May be appropriate for:
- Live investor presentations
- Interactive pitch decks
- Data-driven investor communications
- Situations where interactivity adds value
