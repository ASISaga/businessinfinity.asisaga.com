This investor pitch page is preserved because:
1. It contains unique messaging tailored for investors
2. Different value proposition than user-facing pages
3. May be useful for fundraising or partnership discussions
4. Contains specific metrics and financial projections
5. Demonstrates network effects in a compelling way

## Usage

Not currently linked from main navigation. Access via:

## vs /pitch/

The original `/pitch/` directory contains a different implementation:
