# Backend Integration Guide

## Overview

This document describes the integration between the Business Infinity frontend (this repository) and the Business Infinity backend services.

## Backend Architecture

The Business Infinity backend is a Python-based serverless application built on Azure Functions and the Agent Operating System (AOS). It provides:

- **Strategic Decision Making**: Multi-agent collaborative decision processes
- **Business Workflow Orchestration**: Automated business processes (product launches, funding rounds)
- **Agent Management**: C-Suite agents (CEO, CFO, CTO, CMO, COO), Founder, and Investor agents
- **Trust & Compliance**: GDPR-compliant data export, deletion, and retention policies
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive risk tracking and mitigation
- **Knowledge Management**: Centralized knowledge base with versioning
- **Mentor Mode**: Agent training and fine-tuning capabilities
- **Global Boardroom Network**: Covenant-based compliance for autonomous boardrooms

## Backend Repository

**Repository**: [ASISaga/BusinessInfinity](https://github.com/ASISaga/BusinessInfinity)

### Key Components

1. **Agent Operating System (AOS)** - Infrastructure layer providing:
   - Agent lifecycle management
   - Message bus for inter-agent communication
   - Storage services (Blob, Table, Queue, Cosmos DB)
   - ML pipeline for model training and inference
   - Authentication and authorization
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration

2. **Business Agents** - Specialized AI agents:
   - **ChiefExecutiveOfficer**: Strategic leadership and vision
   - **BusinessCFO**: Financial leadership and analysis
   - **BusinessCTO**: Technology leadership and innovation
   - **FounderAgent**: Vision, innovation, entrepreneurial leadership
   - **InvestorAgent**: Investment analysis and funding strategy

3. **Azure Functions API** - RESTful endpoints for:
   - Health checks and system status
   - Agent interactions and queries
   - Strategic decision making
   - Business workflow execution
   - Trust and compliance operations

## Frontend Integration

### Migration from Legacy Endpoints

The OpenAPI specification includes both legacy and new endpoints for backward compatibility:

**Legacy Endpoints** (Deprecated):
- `/agents` → Use `/api/agents` instead
- `/health` → Use `/api/health` instead

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Update all new code to use `/api/*` endpoints
2. Update existing code incrementally to use new endpoints
3. Legacy endpoints may be removed in future versions

The new endpoints provide enhanced functionality:
- `/api/agents`: Returns detailed agent status and capabilities
- `/api/health`: Returns component-level health status (AOS, Service Bus, Storage, MCP)

### API Base URL

**Production**: `https://cloud.businessinfinity.asisaga.com`

Configured in `/assets/js/config.js`:
```javascript
export const API_BASE_URL = 'https://cloud.businessinfinity.asisaga.com';
```

**Note**: The configuration file also requires Azure AD credentials to be set up:
- `clientId`: Your Azure AD application client ID
- `tenantId`: Your Azure AD tenant ID
- `functionScope`: API scope for your Azure Functions app

These should be configured via environment variables in production rather than hardcoded.

### OpenAPI Specification

The complete API specification is available at:
- Runtime: `/api/openapi.json`
- Cached: `/assets/data/openapi.json`

### Client Libraries

#### BoardroomAPI
Located at `/assets/js/boardroom/boardroomApi.js`

Provides methods for:
- `getAgents()` - List all agents
- `getAgentProfile(agentId)` - Get agent profile
- `startConversation(agentId)` - Start conversation with agent
- `sendMessage(convId, text)` - Send message to conversation
- `getMessages(convId)` - Get conversation messages

#### API Routes
Located at `/assets/js/apiRoutes.js`

Provides dynamic API route resolution using operation IDs from the OpenAPI spec.

## Authentication

The backend uses Azure AD (Entra ID) for authentication:

1. **User Login**: Redirect to Azure AD login page
2. **Token Exchange**: Authorization code exchanged for access token
3. **Token Storage**: Access token stored in sessionStorage
4. **API Calls**: Token included in Authorization header

### Token Management

```javascript
function authHeader() {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
  return token ? { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } : {};
}
```

## Rate Limiting

- **Global**: 1000 requests/hour per user
- **Compliance Endpoints**: 10 requests/hour per user
- **Export/Deletion**: 1 request/24 hours per user

### Rate Limit Headers

The API includes rate limit information in response headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed in the time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets

### Rate Limit Exceeded

When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns:

**Response Code**: `429 Too Many Requests`

**Response Body**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMITED",
    "message": "Too many requests. Please retry after 300 seconds.",
    "details": {
      "retry_after": 300,
      "limit": 1000,
      "window": "1 hour"
    }
  }
}
```

The response includes a `Retry-After` header indicating how long to wait before retrying (in seconds).

## Error Handling

All API errors follow this format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "Missing required parameter: boardroomId",
    "details": {
      "parameter": "boardroomId",
      "location": "query"
    }
  }
}
```

**Error Codes**:
- `INVALID_REQUEST`: Malformed request
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: Missing or invalid authentication
- `FORBIDDEN`: Insufficient permissions
- `NOT_FOUND`: Resource not found
- `RATE_LIMITED`: Too many requests
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`: Server error

## Development

### Local Development

1. Backend runs on Azure Functions locally: `http://localhost:7071`
2. Frontend can connect to local backend by updating `API_BASE_URL` in `/assets/js/config.js`

### Testing

Use the OpenAPI specification to:
- Generate API client code
- Validate requests and responses
- Test API endpoints

### Monitoring

Backend provides:
- Health checks at `/api/health`
- System status at `/status`
- Component availability monitoring

## Global Boardroom Network

The backend supports covenant-based compliance for the Global Boardroom Network:

- **LinkedIn Verification**: Enterprise identity verification
- **Peer Recognition**: Network validation and compliance badges
- **Covenant Ledger**: Immutable inter-boardroom agreement tracking
- **Network Discovery**: Global boardroom peer discovery
- **Federation Support**: Join and participate in boardroom federations
