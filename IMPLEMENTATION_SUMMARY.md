- Purpose and use case
- Key differences from alternatives
- Preservation rationale
- Usage instructions
- Migration considerations

**Directories Documented:**
1. `features/README.md` - Primary features page (13.9 KB, comprehensive)
2. `features2/README.md` - Alternative outcome-focused version
3. `pitch/README.md` - Interactive investor pitch (8.7 KB app.js)
4. `pitch2/README.md` - Simple one-pager pitch
