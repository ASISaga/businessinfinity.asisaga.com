Put commands early: Put relevant executable commands in an early section: npm test, npm run build, pytest -v. Include flags and options, not just tool names. Your agent will reference these often.
Code examples over explanations: One real code snippet showing your style beats three paragraphs describing it. Show what good output looks like.
Set clear boundaries: Tell AI what it should never touch (e.g., secrets, vendor directories, production configs, or specific folders). “Never commit secrets” was the most common helpful constraint.
Be specific about your stack: Say “React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS” not “React project.” Include versions and key dependencies.
Cover six core areas: Hitting these areas puts you in the top tier: commands, testing, project structure, code style, git workflow, and boundaries.
